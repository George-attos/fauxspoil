Project Description
FauxSpoiler is an AI-powered mischief machine that creates absurd yet terrifyingly realistic fake spoilers for movies and TV shows — from Hollywood blockbusters to niche Malayalam dramas.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world suffers from a tragic lack of suspense. People binge-watch in peace, knowing the only spoilers are real ones. This tranquility is unacceptable.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We weaponized AI to instantly fabricate spoilers so authentic-sounding that even the original screenwriters might start doubting their own plotlines.
